## Self-Evaluation

How many points out of 20 do you deserve on this assignment: `0-20`

I think I deserve anywhere from 18-20 points on this assignment because all of the tests passed and I was able to do minor troubleshooting without needing help from an instructor.

## Self-Reflection
<!-- What did you learn that you found interesting -->

I learned that the L and 1 and I are all super simliar on centos/linux and to look very carfeully when scripting lol. The main goal I took from this was no matter the issues I ran into I kept on going using google and some redit posts and found people were having same issue and I was able to get that issue resolved.

### How long it took you to finish this?

I ran into some file path directory problems that took me ahwile but once I got that figured out it took me about 2-3 hours to write the scripts.
